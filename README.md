# Lossless media bot for Telegram

Demo: [https://t.me/lossless_media_bot](@lossless_media_bot)

If you've used Telegram mobile client to upload photos or videos, you know it compresses media and usually it looks creepy and video quality is very low. This bot will help you to upload videos and photos in the original quality.

Add the bot to your channel, send video/photo as file and the bot will convert it into video/photo message without applying any compression. You can do that in the dialog with the bot and then forward the result message to your channel.
